# Learning Management System

## Goals
As a team of software developers whose academic activities are also affected by the current
platform, we have taken a genuine interest in improvement and expansion of the system.
This project aims to build a new cloud-based LMS that is:
- Easy to maintain: Minimized redundancy, concise and comprehensible coding
standards, detailed documentation.
- User-friendly: Aesthetically pleasing interface, purposeful combination of layout,
colors and typography to simplify and enhance user experience.
- All-encompassing: Including more diverse management tools, assessment, analytics
and user feedback.

## Software Architecture
This system implements a three-layer architecture:
- Top tier: Consists of a user interface that displays data and a communication layer
that collects data which can be accessed through a GUI. It is also where end users
can interact with the software in a variety of ways.
- Middle tier: Data from the top level is processed and transformed to give operable
information, which can then be used to modify the bottom tier. It acts as a bridge
for communication between the top and bottom level.
- Bottom tier: Data storage layer which is implemented by using a database
management system.

## Development timeline
Development phases of the product follow the SCRUM framework:
- Pre-developmental work (1-2 weeks): Research, planning, resource allocation.
- Front-end development (2-4 weeks): Interface and front-end structure design.
- Back-end development (2-4 weeks): Database creation and integration.
- QA testing (1-2 weeks): Quality control.

Each phase consists of 1-2 sprints that last 1-2 weeks. At the start of each sprint, the team
leader will hold a meeting where the sprint backlog will be formed from product backlog.
At the end of each day during the sprint, a brief meeting will also be held to ensure quality,
progress and help each member stay on track. Each sprint time box will end with a final
meeting where the team reflects, reviews and compares with goals set out at the start of
said sprint.
